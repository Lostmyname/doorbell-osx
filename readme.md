# Doorbell (OS X)

You're in the office, someone presses the doorbell. Do you try and find Slack and buzz them in from there, taking maybe five or so keystrokes/clicks?

No, you use the handy doorbell menubar client instead!

Doorbell sits in your menubar, right by the time, wifi and probably Dropbox. You click it and the door opens. Could not be more simple.

Requires the doorbell token to build, so you'll need to find someone who already makes doorbell apps to get it.
